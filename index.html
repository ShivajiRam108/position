    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML.
         The most widely used version throughout the 2000's was HTML 4.01, which became an official standard in December 1999. 
         Another version, XHTML, was a rewrite of HTML as an XML language.
         Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
          It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets 
          (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.

         Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
          HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
         
         HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be
          embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such
           as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
            Tags such as  and  directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as and  surround and provide information 
            about document text and may include sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
         
         HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. 
         The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML 
         and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML,
          known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the  element, together with JavaScript.

         In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use 
         and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML
          and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau
           collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990,
            Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]
         
         The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[5] first mentioned on the Internet
          by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML.
           Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language
            (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8]</p>

        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
        
        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
        
        Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
        
        The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which declaration applies if more than one declaration of a property match a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
        
        The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.[5]

     <h1>JavaScript</h1>
     <P>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior.[10]

        Web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine that executes the client code. These engines are also utilized in some servers and a variety of apps. The most popular runtime system for non-browser usage is Node.js.
        
        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
        
        The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.
        
        Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
        
        History
        Creation at Netscape
        The first popular web browser with a graphical user interface, Mosaic, was released in 1993. Accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the early World Wide Web.[12] The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. This quickly became the most-used.[13]
        
        During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a programming language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.[6]
        
        The goal was a "language for the masses",[14] "to help nonprogrammers create dynamic, interactive Web sites".[15] Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.[5][6] Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.[6][1][16][17]
        
        The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java. At the time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was a popular new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a marketing ploy by Netscape.</P>
